# jarvision
A Chrome Extension connecting to our internal Jarvis system at Alviso Recruitment

We hacked this together with a colleague of mine as a fun side-project that turned out to be quite useful.
Well.. he coded, I hacked and uglified the code with broken commits :)

It parses Linkedin profiles against our DB and returns some useful info, such as comments etc.

It's published via Chrome Web Store for our domain only.
