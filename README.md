# jarvision
A Chrome Extension connecting to our internal Jarvis system at Alviso Recruitment

We hacked this together with @pavelkubal as a fun side-project that turned out to be quite useful.
Well.. he coded, I hacked and uglified the code with broken commits :)

It parses Linkedin profiles against our DB and returns some useful info, such as comments etc.

It's published via Chrome Web Store for our domain only.

We moved the production repo to BitBucket. That saved us 7$ a month, approximately 7 beers depending on your taste and location, certainly not a negligible amount!
